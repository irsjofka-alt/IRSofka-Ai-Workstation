# 🗺️ Roadmap — Irsofka AI Workstation

Latest status: **October 7, 2026.** Every verified milestone includes reproducible evidence;
untested components are explicitly labeled. This document consolidates and supersedes
`ai_workstation_master_plan.md` and `PROJECT_SUMMARY_IRSOFKA_AI_WORKSTATION.md` along with `README.md`.

## Phases

```
F1 Brain & Rules Foundation       ✅ Completed
F2 Rust PTY Terminal Engine       ✅ Completed
F3 Telemetry & SQL State          ✅ Completed
F4 Native Rust Window GUI         ✅ Completed
F5 Memory & Session Integrity     ✅ Completed (Oct 6)
F6 Cross-Verification Ecosystem   🟡 In Progress
F7 Creative Studio (ComfyUI/UE5)  ⬜ Planned
```

## F1–F4 — Foundation (Completed & Re-verified Oct 6)

Dual-mode Rust daemon `irsofka-station-core` (`--headless` + native tao/wry desktop window), three
interactive terminal tabs, RTX 3060/RAM/disk telemetry, PostgreSQL 16 with automated SQLite fallback,
hardware MCP server, zero external browser runtime dependency.

## F5 — Memory & Session Integrity ✅ (Completed & Verified Oct 6)

Resolves historical issues where sessions terminated upon daemon restarts and multiline prompts were
prematurely sent upon pressing Enter. Root cause resolved: release binaries were built but not deployed.

Verified improvements:

| Improvement | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Prompt Composer: Enter = new line, Ctrl+Enter = send, Ctrl+Shift+Enter = line-by-line | `curl :8999/` serves `<textarea>` + `handleKey()` with `e.ctrlKey` |
| Tabs hosted in tmux outside daemon cgroup | `/api/workspace` tabs report `backend:"tmux"`; daemon adopts panes (`tmux_adopt`, stable `pane_pid`) |
| Restart-proof sessions | 5× daemon restarts on Oct 6 maintained session `63313f58`; shell cgroup isolated in `irsofka-tabs.service` |
| `--continue` fail-safe | `cli_profiles.json` `continue_session:true` → `run_tab.sh` applies flag automatically |
| Enter dispatched as `\r` instead of `\n` | Fixed legacy bug where prompts were populated into input fields but not submitted |
| Automated handoffs | Hooks `SessionEnd` + `PreCompact` → recorded to `world_memory` & `brain/memory/projects/handoff_auto_*.md` |
| Self-preservation guardrails | `hooks/self_preservation.py` passes 57/57 test cases |
| Verified self-healing | `incident_log` tracks real failures; recurring failures trigger `auto_learned=TRUE` skill creation |
| Honest status dispatcher | Offline engines report `UNAVAILABLE` rather than false `COMPLETED`; writes go through PostgreSQL adapter |
| Backups & restore test | Hourly timer; `station_restore.sh --check` verifies clean restore to temporary DB (2,973 action records) |
| Credentials removed from code | `db_local.json` (gitignored) + environment variables; 0 secrets in git history |
| Clean `$HOME` enforcement | 4.7 GB moved to `~/runtime`; safety guard blocks unapproved dotfiles in `$HOME` |

## F6 — Cross-Verification Ecosystem 🟡

Completed:
- `ai-station verify` — Bidirectional verification between Qoder and Gemini. Verified: Gemini rejects invalid claims and validates sound logic referencing exact source lines (`main.rs:1384`, `1426-1431` — line numbers predate the Oct 7 source split).
- `config/engines.json` — Configuration-based engine registry allowing new engines without code modifications.
- Message box `ai_message` + MCP tools `ask_peer` / `check_messages` / `resolve_message`.
- `local_llm.py` — Tri-guard GPU resource management with VRAM safety gates and CPU/RAM fallback.

Pending:
- ⬜ **Tier `heavy` deployment:** `phi4:14b` evaluation under concurrent GPU workloads.
- ⬜ Real-world cross-engine stress testing with simultaneous ComfyUI / graphical workloads.
- ⬜ Antigravity quota telemetry widget in the GUI (data available via `/api/usage`).

### Verified Milestones (Oct 6)
- ✅ `parallel_tri_engine.py` dynamically loads `config/engines.json`. Legacy hardcoded models removed; `never_load_if` policy enforced: if available VRAM is insufficient, local execution reports `UNAVAILABLE` to PostgreSQL and identifies current GPU processes. Ollama requests pass configured `keep_alive` values.
- ✅ **Privacy redaction in daemon:** `/api/stats` and `/api/usage` sanitize personal identification (emails, real names, user avatars) before exposing metrics.
- ✅ **Toolset catalog updated:** `tools/TOOLSET_CATALOG.md` accurately documents the Rust daemon rather than deprecated Python scripts.
- ✅ **Stale SQLite databases archived:** Stale database copies moved to backups to avoid divergence from PostgreSQL.
- ✅ **Local engines evaluated:** `qwen3.5:4b` and `qwen3.5:9b` benchmarked with `model_check.py` (43.1 tokens/sec, full VRAM deallocation verified).
- ✅ **Zero-response bug resolved:** Set `num_ctx=12288`, `num_predict=1200`, and `think=false` for local verification models to prevent reasoning token starvation.
- ✅ **Symlink guard verified:** Fixed symlink nesting bug (`ln -sfn`) with directory safety guards.
- ✅ **Handoff git tracking corrected:** Accurate repository detection relative to `~/.ai-station` root directory.

### Verified Milestones (Oct 7)

- ✅ **Daemon source split by domain:** `main.rs` reduced from 2,261 to 234 lines. Startup, window and
  the router table are all that remains; behaviour moved to `paths`, `profile`, `terminal`, `spool`,
  `probe`, `engineinfo`, `save_state`, `procinfo` and `api/{workspace,engine,stats,terminal,desktop,daemon,static_files}`.
  Release build: zero warnings. Verified live after deploy — `/api/cli/config` 200, `/api/screenshot/latest`
  772 KB, `/api/term/history` 512 KB, GPU/RAM/disk populated, three tabs `alive`, `db_engine: POSTGRESQL`.
- ✅ **Two portability defects closed during the move:** the PostgreSQL default user was a compiled-in
  constant (`"irsofka"`) that made foreign clones attempt login with an account that is not theirs; and
  `count()` interpolated table names into SQL without validation.
- ✅ **Generated architecture map:** `bin/arch_map.sh` writes `brain/memory/projects/ARCHITECTURE.md`
  (folder → file → purpose), reading each purpose from the file's own header comment — no second copy to
  drift. 68 files mapped, 0 undocumented; refreshed at the end of every deploy; `--check` exits non-zero
  on undocumented files. Contract §11 records the rule for new files.
- ✅ **Memory restore briefing corrected:** duplicate `handoff_auto_*` rows no longer crowd out real
  memory; empty handoffs are neither written nor displayed; session id recovered from the transcript
  filename when the hook payload omits it; budget raised so the briefing no longer truncates its own
  pointer lines.
- ✅ **Binary backup rotation:** `deploy_engine.sh` keeps the 8 newest backups; `bin/` dropped from
  114 MB to 50 MB.

## F7 — Creative Studio ⬜

Planned integration: ComfyUI HTTP API (`:8188`) integration via `comfy_workflow` MCP tool sharing the same VRAM gate to prevent resource contention with local LLMs and graphical viewports.

## Known Boundaries & Constraints

- **Token usage counters:** Some upstream CLI tools record `0` tokens in raw logs; the workstation preserves telemetry integrity without fabricating numbers.
- **CLI session working directory binding:** `--continue` flags bind to specific working directories; cross-directory persistence is bridged via PostgreSQL `world_memory` and handoff documents.
- **Unmovable system dotfiles:** Specific system paths (`.bashrc`, `.config`, `.var`, `.nv`, `.qoder`) remain as required by host tools; runtime data resides in `~/runtime`.
- **Guardrail scope:** Hooks intercept commands executed via AI shell tooling; manual operator commands bypass hooks by design.

## Historical Context

Early revisions of `ai_workstation_master_plan.md` and `PROJECT_SUMMARY_...md` noted 100% completion prematurely before daemon and logging layers were fully productionized. On October 6, 2026, those documents were archived in `~/.ai-station/archive/`, and all verified architectural truth was consolidated into `README.md` and this roadmap.
